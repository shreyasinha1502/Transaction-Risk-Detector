# 🚨 Transaction Risk Detector – Fraud Detection System

A **production-ready machine learning web application** for **real-time transaction fraud detection**, built using **XGBoost**, **Flask**, and **Docker**, and deployed on **Render**.

This system predicts the **fraud probability** of a transaction and classifies it as **Low Risk** or **High Risk**, handling highly imbalanced fraud data effectively.

## 🌐 Live Demo

🔗 **Live Application:**  
https://transaction-risk-detector.onrender.com  

> ⚠️ *Note:* Hosted on Render Free Tier — the service may spin down after inactivity and take ~30–50 seconds to wake up.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Classifier (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees)
- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification (Fraud / Non-Fraud)
- **Imbalance Handling:** `scale_pos_weight`
- **Evaluation Metric:** PR-AUC (Precision–Recall AUC)
- **Output:**
  - Fraud Probability
  - Final Risk Classification (Low Risk / High Risk)

### 📌 Why PR-AUC?
Fraud datasets are highly imbalanced. PR-AUC focuses on **precision and recall of the minority (fraud) class**, making it more reliable than accuracy.

## 🔁 ML Workflow

1. User enters transaction details via UI  
2. Data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame  
3. Preprocessing & encoding handled in pipeline  
4. XGBoost model predicts fraud probability  
5. Result displayed as:
   - **Low Risk** ✅ or **High Risk** 🚨  
   - Fraud Probability score  

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- Application is **containerized using Docker**
- Deployed on **Render Web Service**
- **Auto-deploy enabled** on every push to `main` branch
- Flask app exposed on Render-assigned port

---

## 🛡️ Disclaimer

This project is built for **educational and demonstration purposes** only.  
It should **not** be used as a standalone fraud prevention system in production financial environments without additional security, monitoring, and compliance layers.

## 🎤 Interview One-Liner

> “I built an end-to-end machine learning fraud detection system using XGBoost, handled class imbalance with scale_pos_weight, deployed it as a Dockerized Flask app on Render, and exposed a real-time prediction UI.”

## ⭐ Future Improvements

- Model explainability (SHAP)
- Confidence threshold tuning
- Authentication & rate limiting
- API versioning
- Database logging of transactions
